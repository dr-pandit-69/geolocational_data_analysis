# Geolocational Data Analysis (Streamlit)

This was done as a part of a Data Science Assignment, This project helps new residents of a place find residents based on their preferences in food_coded.csv. The dataset was retrieved from Kaggle 
(https://www.kaggle.com/code/rafalpanasiuk/food-choices-data-exploration-analysis)

Performance maybe a little slow due to real-time rendering of all graphs. Foursquare API key is needed to run the maps section.
